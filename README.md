BBsharp
=======

BBsharp is a library for converting BBCode to HTML. It is written in C#.

### Help Needed!

BBsharp was initially a JavaScript library from Stone Steps before it was ported to C# for use in a personal project by Charlie Somerville. As such, it does the job, but is not quite the best C# code around.

Please help out BBsharp by creating a fork and cleaning up some code.
